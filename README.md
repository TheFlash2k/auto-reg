# auto-reg
An automated script that takes a list of users and registers them on the CTFD platform


Usage:
```
python3 main.py
```

## How to use?
In order to use this, we need to firstly generate an `ACCESS TOKEN` from the Users page. Then, we will have to modify `config.json`. Once done, the script will validate the inputs and then make the requests to add the users.
